## The Definition of Open Source: From Open Source Software to Open Source Resources

### Introduction

What is « open source » ? Commonly associated with software, the meaning of this concept remains very confused and
difficult to grasp. Its definition is already a source of controversy within the software world. In addition, there is a
growing questioning about the meaning of open source beyond software to encompass digital resources that openly provide their
source files. The democratisation of other openness movements (open science, open education, open hardware, open data,
etc.) bring other types of open resources that reinforce these questions. Therefore, could we be on the cusp of a paradigm shift in
the very meaning of open source in the coming years?

### Origin & Context
